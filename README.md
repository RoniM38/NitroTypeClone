# NitroTypeClone

Made with <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/">pygame</a>.<br>
This game is a clone of <a href="https://www.nitrotype.com/">Nitro Type</a>, except it's not a race, rather more of a typing test and it isn't an online game.<br>
I used a countdown sound effect from Mario Kart for the countdown before the game, so credit to Mario Kart for that.<br>

# Gameplay
The game starts off with a menu screen, click the "Play" button to start playing. After clicking on "Play", there will be a three second countdown and you'll be able to start typing right after the countdown. The words you will need to type will be displayed in a text box above the race track. The faster you type, the faster your car will move. Try to type as much words correctly as possible because each mistake will lower your accuracy, which will be displayed after the game. After you finish typing all the words, your results will be displayed (WPM, accuracy and time). You can click on the "menu" button to get redirected to the menu page and play again.<br>Enjoy :)
